# Understanding Digital Content Trends in Bangladesh (YouTube & Google Ads)

## Introduction

Bangladesh is a country with a rich cultural heritage and a rapidly growing digital landscape. As technology continues to play an increasingly important role in the lives of Bangladeshis, there is a growing need to leverage data science and machine learning to address the unique challenges and opportunities in the country.

This repository explores how data science and machine learning can be applied to solve real-world problems and improve the quality of life in Bangladesh.  The projects outlined below focus on addressing online safety, promoting responsible content consumption, and exploring potential solutions in other key areas.

## Projects

**(Current Status: Draft)**

**1. Detecting and Mitigating Gambling Ads on Google Targeting Bangladeshi Users**
[Project Folder](/Gambling_Ad_Detection)

* **Problem:**  The prevalence of online gambling ads targeting Bangladeshi users poses significant financial and social risks.  This project aims to develop a system for automatically detecting and flagging these ads.
* **Data Sources:** Publicly available datasets of gambling ads, Google Ads API (pending approval), web scraping of gambling websites.
* **Methodology:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze ad text and identify gambling-related keywords and phrases. Analysis of ad targeting parameters (e.g., demographics, location) to identify vulnerable populations.
* **Expected Outcomes/Goals:** A model capable of accurately classifying gambling ads, a comprehensive list of keywords and phrases commonly used in such ads targeting Bangladesh, and recommendations for mitigating their reach and impact.
* **Current Status/Progress:** [Current Status - e.g., Data collection in progress, Initial model development]

**2. Identifying and Reducing the Spread of Low-Quality and Inappropriate Content on YouTube in Bangladesh**
[Project Folder](/Low_Quality_Content)

* **Problem:** The proliferation of low-quality and inappropriate content on YouTube, particularly content targeting younger audiences, can have detrimental effects. This project aims to identify and analyze such content and explore strategies for mitigating its impact.
* **Data Sources:** YouTube Data API, web scraping of relevant channels and videos, potentially crowdsourced data for labeling inappropriate content.
* **Methodology:** NLP and sentiment analysis to identify potentially inappropriate language and themes, analysis of video metadata (e.g., tags, descriptions) to detect patterns, and machine learning models to classify videos based on their quality and appropriateness.
* **Expected Outcomes/Goals:** A model for identifying low-quality and inappropriate content, an understanding of the factors contributing to its spread, and recommendations for promoting higher-quality content.
* **Current Status/Progress:** [Current Status - e.g., Defining criteria for "low-quality," Data source exploration]

**3. Analyzing the Impact of Clickbait Titles on User Engagement in Bangla YouTube Videos**
[Project Folder](/Clickbait_Analysis)

* **Problem:**  Clickbait titles are prevalent on YouTube and can manipulate users into clicking on low-quality or irrelevant content. This project analyzes the impact of clickbait titles on user engagement in Bangla YouTube videos.
* **Data Sources:** YouTube Data API, focusing on video titles, views, watch time, comments, and other engagement metrics.
* **Methodology:** NLP techniques to identify clickbait patterns in titles, statistical analysis to correlate clickbait characteristics with engagement metrics.
* **Expected Outcomes/Goals:**  Quantify the impact of clickbait titles on user behavior, identify common clickbait tactics used in Bangla YouTube videos, and potentially develop a clickbait detection model.
* **Current Status/Progress:** [Current Status - e.g., Data collection and preprocessing]

## Future Projects

**Analyzing the Usage of YouTube Kids vs. Regular YouTube by Children in Bangladesh**
[Project Folder](/YouTube_Kids_Usage)

* **Problem:**  Understanding how children in Bangladesh use YouTube Kids versus regular YouTube is crucial for ensuring their online safety and promoting healthy digital habits. This project aims to analyze usage patterns and content consumption differences between the two platforms.
* **Data Sources:**  Surveys of parents and children (with appropriate consent), data from YouTube Kids and regular YouTube APIs (if accessible), potential collaboration with child advocacy groups in Bangladesh.
* **Expected Outcomes/Goals:** Insights into the prevalence and types of content accessed by children on each platform, identification of potential risks and opportunities associated with each platform, and recommendations for promoting safer and more beneficial YouTube usage among children in Bangladesh.

## Key Focus Areas

* **Improving Online Safety:** Addressing misleading and harmful content online, including gambling ads and inappropriate content.
* **Promoting Responsible Content Consumption:** Analyzing user engagement and content recommendations to encourage healthier online habits and promote access to quality content.
